# Mapping the Milky Way using 21 cm HI line emission

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our **Bachelor’s project** at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/). Under the guidance of **Professor Suprit Singh**, this project aims to derive the ***Rotation curve** and **map the spiral arms of the Milky Way Galaxy** using data from galactic neutral hydrogen (HI) emissions conducted over the course of a single semester. This data is obtained using a **pyramidal horn antenna**, tuned to observe 21 cm (1420.4 MHz) emission from interstellar HI clouds concentrated in the spiral arms of the galaxy, and processed to infer spatial and kinematic properties of the Milky Way.



## Acknowledgments
This project was presented to an audience of over **3,000 high school students**, fostering interest in astronomy and space science. The event received **national media coverage**, showcasing the importance of science outreach.

I am deeply grateful to **Professor Suprit Singh** for his invaluable guidance and mentorship. His expertise in cosmology and theoretical astrophysics was instrumental in shaping the project and ensuring its success.
